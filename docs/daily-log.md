**Source:** [DreamCoder: bootstrapping inductive program synthesis with wake-sleep library learning](https://github.com/mlb2251/dreamcoder) (Ellis et al., PLDI 2021; compression/refactoring algorithm)

**Mechanism:** Library Learning — extracting frequently occurring subtrees from elite programs in the MAP-Elites archive and promoting them to new primitive operations in the vocabulary.

**Integration:** Added `LibraryLearner` class to main.py. The learner:
1. Scans all elite trees in the archive for subtrees of depth >= `min_subtree_depth`
2. Groups by structural fingerprint, filters by frequency >= `min_frequency`
3. Ranks by `frequency * depth` (compression value heuristic)
4. Converts top candidates into new `PrimitiveOp` entries with correct arity detection (unary if subtree contains `input_x`, nullary otherwise)
5. Registers them in the vocabulary with discounted cost

Integrated into `MetaGrammarLayer.expand_design_space()` — library learning fires with 50% probability when elite trees are available, alongside existing meta-rules.

Updated `build_rsi_system()` factory with `use_library_learning`, `library_min_depth`, `library_min_freq`, `library_max_additions` parameters.

**New capability:** The system can now break its own depth ceiling. Previously, with `max_depth=D`, the system could only express computations requiring at most `D` levels of nesting. After library learning extracts a depth-K subtree as a single primitive, a depth-D tree using that primitive can express what previously required depth `D+K`. This is a genuine expansion of F_theo — the set of representable functions grows strictly larger after each library learning step, unlike `_meta_compose_new_op` which only randomly chains unary ops.

**Tests:** 45/45 pass (38 existing + 7 new)
- `test_extract_from_repeated_subtrees` — verifies extraction triggers on shared subtrees
- `test_extracted_op_computes_correctly` — verifies semantic correctness of extracted ops
- `test_no_extraction_below_frequency_threshold` — verifies frequency filter
- `test_no_duplicate_extraction` — verifies idempotency
- `test_depth_amplification` — **critical**: demonstrates depth ceiling bypass
- `test_library_learning_with_engine_integration` — full engine integration smoke test
- `test_constant_subtree_extraction` — verifies arity-0 extraction for constant subtrees

**Branch:** `upgrade/20260324-library-learning`
