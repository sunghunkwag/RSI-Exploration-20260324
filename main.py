"""RSI-Exploration: Recursive Self-Improvement Architecture
=========================================================

A hybrid architecture combining:
1. Darwin Godel Machine (DGM) self-improvement loops
2. MAP-Elites quality-diversity search

The system implements three-layer design space expansion:
- Vocabulary Layer: primitive operations that can be composed
- Grammar Layer: rules for composing vocabulary into programs
- Meta-Grammar Layer: rules for generating new grammar rules

Physical cost grounding is provided through a resource accounting
system that tracks compute, memory, and wall-clock time.

Inspired by:
- guillaumepourcel/dgm (Darwin Godel Machine)
- b-albar/evolve-anything (LLM-powered MAP-Elites)
